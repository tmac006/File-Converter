# File Converter

A full-stack file conversion application that aims to provide seamless file format conversions with a modern web interface.

 ## Project Status: Early Development

This project is currently in its initial development phase. The goal is to evolve it into a full-stack application with both backend conversion capabilities and a modern frontend interface.

 ## Current Features

- Basic file conversion functionality (in development)
- Python-based backend using Pillow for image processing

 # Planned Features

## Backend Development

  - [ ] Video files (MP4, AVI, etc.)
- [ ] Batch processing capabilities
- [ ] File compression options
- [ ] Error handling and validation
- [ ] API endpoint development
- [ ] File upload/download functionality

## Frontend Development
- [ ] Modern React/Next.js web interface
